### Introduction  
Our privacy policy will help you understand what information we collect at কৃষক বন্ধু, how FieldScanBd uses it, and what choices you have.
FieldScanBd built the কৃষক বন্ধু app as a free app. This SERVICE is provided by FieldScanBd at no cost and is intended for use as is.
If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in  relation with this policy. The Personal Information that we collect are used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.  
The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible in our website, unless otherwise  defined in this Privacy Policy.

### Information Collection and Use  
For a better experience while using our Service, we may require you to provide certain information. This includes farmer data (such as name, phone number, NID, and address), which is entered manually by the user.
We do not automatically collect personal data such as email, gender, location, or photos unless explicitly provided by the user.
The data entered by the user is used only for generating reports and storing records within the app or the user's authorized account.
We do not share any user-entered data with government entities or third parties, except where required by law.

All data entered by the user (such as farmer information) is stored locally on the user's device using a secure local database (SQLite).
The app also provides an optional feature to back up or sync data to our Firebase server. This process is initiated by the user and helps ensure data availability across devices.

Disclaimer: This app is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially connected to any government organization.

### Data Storage and Sharing
Local Storage: Your data remains on your device unless you choose to upload it.

Cloud Storage (Firebase): If you choose to upload data, it is stored securely on Firebase servers managed by Google.

Data Sharing: We do not share your data with third parties or government agencies. Data is only accessible to you (or those you explicitly authorize).

### Location Information
